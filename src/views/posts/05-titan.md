Austro-Behemian composer Gustav Mahler lived in the late 19th century and early 20th century. His birthplace was part of the Austrian Empire when he was born, and is in the current day Czech. Some people of our time who have been to Mahler's birthplace say it hasn't changed much. How do we know? It could involve asking someone who is old enough to know someone who is old enough to know. But even if we do get some sort of description, it would still be rather distant from how Mahler perceived it.

As we are stuck home during COVID-19 lockdowns, it becomes even more remote to imagine when we can see what is there in a mid-European town. But, as a magical musician, we can _hear_ what was in Mahler's ears. We hear birds sing, song emerges from the cuckoos, color of dawn.
