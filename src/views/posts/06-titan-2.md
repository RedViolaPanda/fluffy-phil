Does music have to be about _something_?

In Western music, a lot of music is _abstract_, meaning it isn't about anything. It's just pure music. Symphony No.5, Concerto No.1 in C, and so on.

In China, most music is indeed about something. The most famous violin concerto in China, _The Butterfly Lovers_, is about an ancient Chinese "Romeo and Juliet" story. [Fisherman's Harvest Song](https://youtu.be/D0YZ6jDq3sQ), as its name suggests, is about fisherman's harvests.

I believe a Chinese mind is even happier when the music is about something tangible. I guess that is why, when a famous children's song, _Frère Jacques_, came to China, it was popularized as _Two Tigers_ – the lyrics goes "two tigers, two tigers, one of them has no eyes, one of them has no tail, how peculiar!".

Mahler's 1 can safely categorize as music _about something_. If you listen the symphony, you hear a vivid scene. It _must be_ about something, what is it, though? For a few early performances, the composer labeled it as "Titan", after a novel by Jean Paul. But he discarded the label later on, and also specified that the music was "not in any way 'about' the book".

Mahler is also a composer who, albeit specifying a lot in his scores, he also instructs that after his death, conductors should interpret the music by themselves. I think this aligns perfectly with the fact that music is, at the end of the day, abstract. Anybody can give it some meaning, but the meaning is _in addition_ to what the music is. The composer can compose music based on very specific scenario, an elegy for a beloved person, but also exactly because that meaning doesn't tie to the music, we can hear an elegy and think someone we love.

The funeral march in the 3rd movement is a French children's song that Mahler immortalized. A line of timpani starts the march. A bass solo joins. And a few steps behind you hear a second line march in, and then a third, until an oboe solo hovers on top of all the marches, like a bird. Then somehow the scene turns pastoral, and then an exotic group of dancers takes over for a while, before the original march comes back. 

Some believe that the first symphony is about death of a child. Mahler had experienced lost of a brother when he was very young.
