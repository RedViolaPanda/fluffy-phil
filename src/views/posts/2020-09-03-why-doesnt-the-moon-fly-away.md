## G. P. Telemann

[Georg Philipp Telemann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Philipp_Telemann) was a German composer in the Baroque period. He was good friend with Bach, who was 4 years younger. A little further away in Venice there was Antonio Vivaldi, who was 3 years senior. Telemann was not born in a music family. His father died early, and his mother did not support him to pursuit a music career. He was nearly completely self-taught. Up until college he was still pursuing law, but eventually chose a career in music. He went on to become extremely prolific and in his contemporary time was considered one of the leading composers.

Another interesting read about Telemann is the [autobiography](https://www.bach-cantatas.com/Other/TelemannEPMattheson.pdf) he wrote for himself. In fact, he wrote three of them. He's quite brief. This one is only a few pages long. He talked about his major life events, and listed out pieces he wrote, or gave a number if he'd written too many.

Telemann was also a printer. He started a printing business and published music for himself and his friends such as Bach and Handel. At the beginning of his entrepreneurship, he did everything by himself, including engraving the types and marketing!

## The viola concerto...

This concerto is the first viola concerto we know. Back in the time the violin family of instruments were invented, they were invented to double human voice. The violins were to double the soprano, cellos the bass, and the violas to double the tenor and the alto. Violas were not traditionally intended as a solo instrument to begin with. But Telemann wrote a concerto for it anyway.

What made him do it? Was it because he liked the instrument? Was it because he wanted a particular tone? Also don't know. Whatever it is, however, Telemann does strike me as someone who would go about writing a viola concerto even if no one else had. He also wrote concertos for recorders. In fact, he wrote many of them ðŸ˜†

What did Telemann have in mind when he wrote the concerto? Not possible to know... Telemann was also not too specific about how he meant the piece to be played. Musicians are to present their own interpretations. Here's Viola's version, what is yours?
