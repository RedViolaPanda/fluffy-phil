## Franz Peter Schubert

Franz Peter Schubert was an Austrian composer straddling the late Classical and early Romantic eras. In spite of his short life, he was extremely prolific, with more than 1500 works under his name.

Arguably one of the most poetic musicians who ever lived, he had a knack for melodic and harmonic invention that allowed him to create lasting masterpieces that have been well-loved by audiences even up till today.

## About the Trout theme

_The Trout theme_ originally came from the lied “Die Forelle” (“The Trout”) written by Schubert in 1817. Later, upon suggestion by Sylvester Paumgartner of Steyr in Upper Austria, a wealthy music patron and amateur cellist, Schubert wrote a quintet of which the 4th movement is a theme and variations based on The Trout.

The adorable melody later on attracted the attention of Beethoven as well as George Gershwin, both worked on the theme themselves. You can hear their versions in the lecture [Inside Chamber Music with Bruce Adolphe: Schubert "Trout" Quintet in A Major, D. 667, Op. 114](https://youtu.be/CULfYiee6MM).
