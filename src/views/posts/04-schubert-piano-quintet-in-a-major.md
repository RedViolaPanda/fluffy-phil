## Franz Peter Schubert

Franz Peter Schubert was an Austrian composer straddling the late Classical and early Romantic eras. In spite of his short life, he was extremely prolific, with more than 1500 works under his name.

Arguably one of the most poetic musicians who ever lived, he had a knack for melodic and harmonic invention that allowed him to create lasting masterpieces that have been well-loved by audiences even up till today.

## About the Trout theme 

_The Trout theme_ originally came from the lied “Die Forelle” (“The Trout”) written by Schubert in 1817. The lyrics in the original lied are from a poem which tells the story of a trout being caught by a fisherman, but in its final stanza reveals its purpose as a moral piece warning young women to guard against young men. However, when Schubert composed the lied, he left out the final stanza, making it purely about "a person's observation of the trout and the reaction to its being caught by a fisherman". Later, upon suggestion by Sylvester Paumgartner of Steyr in Upper Austria, a wealthy music patron and amateur cellist, Schubert wrote a quintet of which the 4th movement is a theme and variations based on The Trout.

The lovely melody later on attracted more composers to work on it. You can hear their versions in the lecture [Inside Chamber Music with Bruce Adolphe: Schubert "Trout" Quintet in A Major, D. 667, Op. 114](https://youtu.be/CULfYiee6MM). In fact, the theme melody is so adorable it should be no surprise that it be used in other places.

Not sure if it was because the piece was commissioned by a celist, the theme and variations has a great cello presence in it. Our cellist Marina the otter loves this piece from head to tail. She is also known to love eating fish. Although having a gentle personality as she is, she sometimes gets a bit scared when an agressive fish is caught.
## Notable performances

Of all the performances of the quintet, the most notable is perhaps the music film documenting _Du Pré_, _Perlman_, _Barenboim_, _Mehta_ and _Zukerman_ playing "The Trout" quintet in the 60s. Performers Perlman and Zukerman are worldly renowned violinists and violist today. Du Pré and Barenboim were once considered a "golden couple" in the classical music community. Unfortunately, cellist Du Pré died in 1987, at age 42. You may not have time for the whole film, then perhaps at least listen to [the fourth movement](https://youtu.be/b8-H0r0iL6Q?t=2252).
