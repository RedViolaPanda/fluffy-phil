  <h1>Nonsen & Nonsen</h1>
  <p>Once upon a time, there were two blob friends. We shall call them Nonsen and Nonsen. One day, Nonsen asked Nonsen if she could draw a red panda hugging a viola. Nonsen responded in the affirmative, and this marked the start of the Wonderful World of Fluffy Musicians.</p>
  <p>Okay, this is actually a side project by <a href="https://wgao19.cc">Gao Wei</a> and <a href="https://chenhuijing.com">Chen Hui Jing</a>, but the reality is pretty close to the Nonsenz story. Wei is a violinist turned violist, and her musical explorations are the source of many of our stories and fluffy characters.</p>
